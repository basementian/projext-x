# Security Policy

## Supported versions

This project is in active development. Security fixes are applied to the current default branch.

## Reporting a vulnerability

If you discover a security issue, please do **not** file a public issue.

Instead:

1. Contact maintainers privately.
2. Include a clear description, affected components, and reproduction steps.
3. Share impact assessment if known.

Maintainers will acknowledge reports as quickly as possible and coordinate remediation and disclosure.

## Disclosure process

- We validate and triage reports.
- We prepare a fix and tests.
- We coordinate release timing with reporters when appropriate.
